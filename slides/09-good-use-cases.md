### Use cases

##### Good choice if:

* Need to develop quickly
* Care about code simplicity & testability
* Care about knowledge base and support
* Don't care about startup time
* Don't care about resource demands
* Not concerned with size of deployable binaries

Note:

* Support -  Large user base on Stackoverflow, good support from Pivotal
* Startup time - can be high due to significant one-time initialization costs (DI container, etc.)
* Binary size - application can easily grow to several 100s of MB
