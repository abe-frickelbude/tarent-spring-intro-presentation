### Use cases

##### Possibly a bad choice if:

* Only have a very simple business use case
* Need to develop for embedded platforms
* Need to keep an eye on resource demands
* Care about startup / deployment time
* Care about final binary size
* Care about enhanced performance

Note:

* Embedded systems / constrained resources - Java won't win any speed records anyway, but Spring will make it even a bit worse
