### Alternatives

##### Other programming languages
<br/>

* Golang features a comprehensive HTTP server/middleware library
* ExpressJS
  * Extensive feature set
  * Functionally-oriented programming model
* JS ecosystem a viable alternative for small / medium-sized
projects
* Both approaches produce compact binaries  

Note:

- Explain how ExpressJS can be used to set up a simple, 
compact microservice

- Explain some advantages of the JS-based approach 
(Very fast VM due to V8 in NodeJS, simple programming model etc.)

- Additional advantage: drastically reduced app startup times
and potentially lower memory requirements, potentially simpler 
deployment
